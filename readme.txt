## Notes 

IMPORTANT: Theme modifications via the customize are hooked to the theme_mods rather than options.
This means that if you change the theme name or theme folder name, the modifications will
be losts from the customizer. 

The theme_mods stay with the theme. Child themes will not have theme mods.
